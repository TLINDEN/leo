HISTORY

 WWW::Dict::Leo::Org exists as the script "leo" since 1999,
 which is used widely on earth. Begining with version 1.28 I
 extracted the most significant code into an extra perlmodule
 (WWW::Dict::Leo::Org), so that the translation feature can
 be used from perl too.

 However, the commandline script "leo" still exists, it will
 be installed together with the module.

 Please note, that the script from 1.28 on is no more usable
 in standalone form, in fact it uses the module to do the
 job now.
